    <p class="services-heading-4 mt-5">Introduction :</p>
    <p>I graduated from Army Medical College in 2007 , then completed my General surgery
        training at Combined Military Hospital Rawalpindi( 2010-2013). I obtained my 2 years
        breast surgery fellowship from Shauakt Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and
        Research Center Lahore ( 2013-2015 ) . Following that I was invited to establish a
        dedicated breast surgery department and Combined Military Hospital Rawalpindi. I
        completed the task and remained as pioneer surgeon and Supervisor ( 2016-2021).
        After establishing a breast unit at CMH Rawalpindi I worked side by side to establish a
        dedicated breast unit at the private sector. Nisa Breast Care &amp; Cosmetic Center is the
        first of its kind in the private sector.</p>

    <p>I obtained fellowship from American College of Surgeon (FACS ) in 2019 , I am fellow
        of Royal College of Surgeons Glasgow (2019) . I completed my fellowship of European
        Board of Breast surgery in 2023 .</p>

    <p>After completing various workshops from UK &amp; USA including ultrasound for surgeons,
        stereotactic biopsy, medical tattooing, and Oncoplastic &amp; Reconstructive Breast surgery
        hands-on workshops. I felt the need of complex oncoplastics training as many patients
        were candidates of partial mastectomy or complete mastectomy. Therefore I moved to
        the UK for further training in reconstructive and cosmetic breast surgery 2022-2023. I
        completed my fellowship in oncoplastic and reconstructive breast surgery in August
        2023 from NHS .</p>

    <p>Currently I am working as a consultant oncoplastic and reconstructive breast surgeon at
        Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust. I visit Pakistan frequently to continue
        providing high quality of care to our own population. The idea is to provide standard of
        care services to my Pakistani population while continuing my learning curve for complex
        oncoplastic from UK . The clinic is mainly run by the team members I work remotely for
        second opinions( online consultations ) and as a visiting consultant.</p>

    <p>I introduced the concept of breast physicians these Doctors are 2 years trained in
        breast clinical assessment, benign disease management, breast awareness workshops
        and cancer follow up clinics, Breast nurse practitioners and Breast Care nurses (These
        nurses provide high level of care to the patient in the coordination of investigations &amp;
        post-operative care ) . I also introduced Medical pigmentation services for patient who
        has to loose nipple area as a part of their cancer treatment.</p>
