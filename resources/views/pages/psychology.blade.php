    <p class="services-heading-3">The Importance of Psychological Support</p>

    <p>Stress, depression, anxiety, and other disease-related side effects sometimes interfere with treatment and impact patients' quality of life.</p>

    <p>Coping successfully can have a substantial impact on the quality of life of patients and
        those around them. Through psychological support, we can adjust medication, clarify
        the medical and psychological aspects of disease and treatment, and suggest
        treatment for depression while avoiding drug interactions and the worsening of side
        effects.</p>

    <p>At Nisa breast center, an individualized approach is applied that recognizes the
        difference in adjustment to diagnosis, disease-related physical challenges, and side
        effects depending on age, personality, background, and beliefs.</p>
