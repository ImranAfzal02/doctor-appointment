    <p class="services-heading-1 mt-5">BREAST SCREENING</p>
    <p>
        Breast screening is a proactive approach for the early detection of breast cancer in asymptomatic individuals. </p>
    <p>We offer breast screening for normal population above the age of 40 years, this may
        include women with family history of breast or ovarian cancer ,and self referrals for
        breast assessment.</p>

    <p>The screening process typically includes:</p>


    <p><span class="services-heading-3">Clinical Breast Examination (CBE):</span> A physical examination conducted by a healthcare professional to check for lumps or abnormalities in the breast.</p>

    <p><span class="services-heading-3">Breast Self-Exams (BSE):</span> While not a substitute for professional screening, self-exams empower individuals to be aware of changes in their breasts.</p>

    <p><span class="services-heading-3">Mammography:</span> A primary screening tool involving X-ray images of the breast tissue, recommended annually or biennially. Mammograms can detect tumors that may be too small to be felt.</p>

    <p><span class="services-heading-3">Ultrasound Breast:</span> In conjunction with mammography, ultrasound may be recommended, especially for women with dense breast tissue or as a follow-up to clarify findings from a mammogram. Ultrasound provides additional imaging and can help differentiate between fluid-filled cysts and solid masses.</p>

    <p>In the event of a detected lump, the following steps may be taken:<p>

    </div>

    <p class="mt-4"><span class="services-heading-3">Biopsy:</span> If a lump is found and its nature cannot be conclusively determined through imaging, or if it appears suspicious, a biopsy may be recommended. This involves the removal of a small tissue sample for examination to determine whether it is cancerous.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 mb-5">Additionally:</p>

    <p><span class="services-heading-3">Age and Risk Considerations:</span> Screening recommendations often consider age and individual risk factors. Starting regular screening at a specified age (commonly around 40 or 50) and the frequency of screenings may vary based on guidelines and individual risk assessments.</p>

    <p>Regular breast screening, inclusive of mammography, ultrasound, and clinical examinations, enhances the chances of early detection. In case of suspicious findings or a palpable lump, a biopsy becomes a crucial diagnostic step for determining the nature of the abnormality and guiding further intervention. Always consult with your healthcare provider to tailor a screening plan that aligns with your unique medical history and risk factors.
