    <p class='services-heading'>BENIGN BREAST CONDITIONS</p>
    <p>
    Benign breast conditions are non-cancerous changes in the breast tissue that are very common and usually not harmful. 
    Benign breast conditions may cause lumps, pain, discharge, or other symptoms, but they do not spread to other parts of the body.
    Some benign breast conditions may increase the risk of breast cancer, while others do not. 
    Examples of benign breast conditions include cysts, fibroadenomas, fibrocystic changes, hyperplasia, papillomas, and mastitis. </p>

    <p><span class='sub-heading-bold'>Nipple discharge:</span>
     Nipple discharge is the fluid that comes out of the nipple in one or both breasts. Nipple discharge can be normal or abnormal depending on the cause, color, consistency, and associated symptoms. 
     Normal nipple discharge may be due to pregnancy, breastfeeding, hormonal changes, medication, or stimulation. 
     Abnormal nipple discharge may be due to infection, injury, duct ectasia, papilloma, or rarely, breast cancer. 
     Nipple discharge is always abnormal in men or people assigned male at birth. </p>


    <p><span class='sub-heading-bold'> Breast pain:</span> 
    Breast pain is the discomfort or soreness in one or both breasts. 
    Breast pain can be cyclical or noncyclical. 
    Cyclical breast pain is related to the menstrual cycle and usually affects both breasts. 
    It is caused by hormonal fluctuations and is more common in younger women. 
    Noncyclical breast pain is not related to the menstrual cycle and usually affects one breast. 
    It can be caused by various factors such as injury, infection, inflammation, cysts, fibroadenomas, or rarely, breast cancer.</p>


    <p><span class='sub-heading-bold'>Breast cyst: </span> 
    A breast cyst is a round or oval fluid-filled sac within the breast. Breast cysts are benign and do not increase the risk of breast cancer. 
    Breast cysts may vary in size and number, and may cause pain, tenderness, or lumpiness in the breast. 
    Breast cysts are more common in women between 35 and 50 years old. 
    Breast cysts may go away on their own or may need to be drained by a needle. </p>

    <p><span class='sub-heading-bold'>Fibroadenoma:</span>
     A fibroadenoma is a solid, rubbery, noncancerous tumor that grows in the breast tissue. 
     Fibroadenomas are the most common type of benign breast tumor in young women. 
     Fibroadenomas may feel like a smooth, round, movable lump in the breast. 
     Fibroadenomas do not increase the risk of breast cancer, but some types may be associated with a slightly higher risk. 
     Fibroadenomas may shrink or disappear over time or may need to be removed by surgery. </p>


     <p><span class='sub-heading-bold'>Phyllodes tumor:</span> A phyllodes tumor is a rare, fast-growing tumor that develops in the connective tissue of the breast. 
     Phyllodes tumors can be benign, borderline, or malignant. Phyllodes tumors may feel like a firm, painless lump in the breast. Phyllodes tumors can grow very large and may distort the shape of the breast. 
     Phyllodes tumors may recur or spread to other parts of the body if not treated properly. The main treatment for phyllodes tumors is surgery to remove the tumor and some surrounding tissue.</p>


     <p><span class='sub-heading-bold'>Breast abscess: </span>A breast abscess is a collection of pus in the breast, usually caused by a bacterial infection. 
     Breast abscesses are more common in women who are breastfeeding, but they can also occur in women who are not. 
     Breast abscesses may cause symptoms such as fever, redness, swelling, pain, or nipple discharge in the affected breast. 
     Breast abscesses may be treated with antibiotics, pain relievers, warm compresses, or drainage by a needle or surgery. </p>

    <p><span class='sub-heading-bold'>Mastitis:</span> Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast tissue, usually caused by a bacterial infection or a blocked milk duct. 
    Mastitis is more common in women who are breastfeeding, but it can also occur in women who are not. 
    Mastitis may cause symptoms such as fever, chills, redness, swelling, pain, or nipple discharge in the affected breast. 
    Mastitis may be treated with antibiotics, pain relievers, warm compresses, or frequent breastfeeding or pumping.</p>

    <p><span class='sub-heading-bold'>Lactational conditions:</span> Lactational conditions are problems that affect the breast during or after breastfeeding. 
    Lactational conditions may include engorgement, plugged ducts, mastitis, abscess, nipple pain, nipple damage, nipple thrush, or low milk supply. 
    Lactational conditions may cause discomfort, pain, or difficulty with breastfeeding. 
    Lactational conditions may be prevented or treated with proper breastfeeding techniques, hygiene, support, and care. </p>

    <p><span class='sub-heading-bold'>Fibrocystic breast changes:</span>
     Fibrocystic breast changes are a common condition that causes the breasts to feel lumpy, dense, or tender, especially before the menstrual period.
      Fibrocystic breast changes are caused by hormonal fluctuations that affect the breast tissue. 
      Fibrocystic breast changes are benign and do not increase the risk of breast cancer. 
      Fibrocystic breast changes may be relieved by over-the-counter pain relievers, oral contraceptives, or supportive bras.</p>
  
      
    <p><span class='sub-heading-bold'>Gynecomastia:</span>
     Gynecomastia is the enlargement of the breast tissue in men or people assigned male at birth. 
     Gynecomastia can affect one or both breasts and may cause pain, tenderness, or nipple discharge. 
     Gynecomastia can be caused by various factors such as hormonal imbalance, medication, drug use, liver disease, kidney disease, or obesity. 
     Gynecomastia may resolve on its own or may need to be treated with medication or surgery.</p>
