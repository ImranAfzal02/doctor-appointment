    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">WHAT SIGNS TO LOOK OUT FOR IN SELF BREAST EXAMINATION
    </p>

    <p>During a Breast Self-Examination (BSE), you should be attentive to various changes in your breasts. Here are key changes to look for:
    </p>

    <p>Lumps or Masses: Feel for any new, hard lumps or masses in the breast tissue. Keep in mind that some areas may naturally feel lumpy due to glandular tissue, but any new, distinct lump should be assessed.
    </p>

    <p>Changes in Size or Shape: Observe for alterations in the size or shape of your breasts. Note if one breast appears larger or has a different contour than the other.
    </p>

    <p>Skin Changes: Look for changes in the skin texture, such as redness, dimpling, or puckering. Any changes in the appearance of the skin on your breasts or nipples should be addressed.
    </p>

    <p>Nipple Changes: Pay attention to any changes in the nipples, including changes in direction, inversion, or discharge. Unexplained nipple discharge, especially if it's bloody, should be reported to a healthcare professional.
    </p>

    <p>Breast Pain or Discomfort: While breast pain can be normal and related to the menstrual cycle, persistent or new-onset pain that is not cyclical should be evaluated.
    </p>

    <p>Swelling or Thickening: Detect any swelling, thickening, or changes in the texture of the breast tissue. This may include areas that feel unusually dense or different from the surrounding tissue.
    </p>

    <p>Changes in Appearance: Observe for any changes in the appearance of the breast skin, such as redness . Changes in the color or texture of the skin could be indicative of a concern.
    </p>

    <p>It's important to note that breast changes can occur for various reasons, and many of them are not cancerous. However, any persistent or unusual changes should be discussed with a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. Regular BSE, along with clinical breast examinations and mammograms as recommended by your healthcare provider, contributes to comprehensive breast health monitoring. If you notice any of these changes during your self-exam, seek prompt medical attention for further evaluation and guidance.
