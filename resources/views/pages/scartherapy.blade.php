<p><span class="sub-heading-bold">3D nipple tattooing: </span>3D nipple tattooing is a type of medical tattooing that recreates the appearance of the nipple and areola on the reconstructed breast after a mastectomy or nipple removal. It uses specialized pigments and techniques to create a realistic 3D effect. It can be done as a standalone procedure or after nipple reconstruction.</p>
<p><span class="sub-heading-bold">Camouflage scar therapy: </span>Camouflage scar therapy is a type of medical tattooing that improves the appearance of scars that are discolored or altered in pigmentation and stand out because of the difference in color compared to the surrounding skin. It uses natural pigments that match the skin tone to blend the scar into the background. It can be done on scars from surgery, injury, burns, or skin conditions.</p>
