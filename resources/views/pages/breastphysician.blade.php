    <p>Breast physicians possess specialized expertise in diagnosing and treating both benign and malignant breast conditions. They work closely with a multidisciplinary team consisting of breast surgeons, radiologists, pathologists and oncologists to provide comprehensive care. With a deep understanding of various disciplines and processes involved in breast disease management, breast physicians ensure patients receive optimal diagnosis, treatment, and care.
    </p>

    <p>The pioneering concept of specialized breast care was introduced in Pakistan by Dr. Razia Bano in 2016. Since then, she has been actively involved in training general physicians to specialize in breast diseases, providing an enhanced model for effective management and screening of breast diseases, in an underdeveloped country like Pakistan, dealing with breast cancer as one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in Pakistan.

    <p>At Nisa Breast Care and Cosmetic Center, Dr. Maryam Nazir and Dr. Aneeza Shams have been serving as Breast physicians for the past two and four years, respectively. With their expertise, they collaborate with a multidisciplinary team including breast surgeons, radiologists, pathologists and oncologists to ensure the best possible care for our patients.</p>

    <p>They oversee various aspects of breast health, from diagnosis to treatment. They conduct screenings and triple assessments for breast cancer, offer interventions such as biopsies and surgical procedures, and provide comprehensive care for conditions like seroma, wound, and lymphedema. Moreover, playing a role in preparing and coordinating surgical management with surgeons, while also providing counseling and support to patients facing breast cancer diagnosis and risk assessment.

    <p>Beyond direct patient care, they are also committed to community education and awareness initiatives, promoting breast self-examination for early detection through workshops and distributing informative pamphlets. In short they are catering to our patient concerns at our One Stop Breast Clinics, designed to offer specialized care under one roof. The center also plans to initiate short clinical rotations for our breast physicians at NHS starting 2024, continuous learning and improvement in breast care practices. Our Breast Physicians are dedicated to ensure that our patients receive compassionate, comprehensive, and guideline-adherent care at every step of their breast health journey.
